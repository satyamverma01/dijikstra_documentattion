# dijikstra_documentattion


This repository contains a C++ implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, designed to compute the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. The core function, dijkstra Algorithm, takes as input an adjacency matrix representing the graph and a starting node. It returns a vector of shortest distances from the source node to each other node in the graph. To use this implementation, clone the repository and ensure you have a C++ compiler. Compile the code using a standard C++ compiler like g++, and link any necessary libraries. The graph should be represented by a 2D vector where graph[i][j] holds the weight of the edge from node i to node j, with INT_MAX used to indicate no direct connection. After defining the graph and the source node, invoke the dijkstra Algorithm function to get the shortest paths, which can be printed or processed as required. The repository includes example code and test cases to validate the implementation. Contributions to enhance or fix the code are encouraged, and users can contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests.
